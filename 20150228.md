html
head
  title

/head
body
  div container
  /div

load the dom first.. and the page

<script src="timer.js"></script>

/body
/html

integers and floating point numbers.

4 | 3 bitwise or

no string interpolation in Javascript

doesn't distinguish between single quotes and double quotes.

Adding 3 + '2' gets 32. Subtraction 3 - '2' gets 1. NaN is not a number. isNaN whoa.

Use typeof 4 to get type. NaN comparisons always use false.

#### Don't use double eqauls for comparison

Use triple equals for strict comparison. true == 1 returns true ! Of different types, try to convert then compare.

PS php requires semi colons.

### Array

pop is a function

### Objects

looks like hash. Symbol is really a string. Can add new name value pairs just like Ruby hash.

### Functions

 Add functions to objects in the same way you can add attriutes to objects. Objects are first level data types.
This is a little funky.

Argument Error. JavaScript doesn't care. Never have to use the splat operator.

sayHi.length. get at them using the aruments keyword.


### Object Oriented JavaScript -- it's a function

every function can be used as a constructor. This is weird. It's not self.

````ruby
class Foo
  def initialize
    @bar = 'baz'
  end
end
````

````javascript
function Foo() {
  this.bar = 'baz'
}
````
Add attributes and functionality to instantiations of object. Memory for making prototype is made once.

Add same to prototype of object.  Apple.prototype.eatMe. Can change behaviour even after the fact.
All are constructor functions so they can all have prototypes. It is dirty for an instance to change the behaviour
of everyone. However useful to add to prototype after the fact.

Attributes can be instance driven. But functions?
You may want everyone to inherit those.

this.color refers to whatever function is responsible for calling the function.

### Meta-programming in JavaScript

Apple.addMethod('rot', function() {
  this.isRipe = false;
})

this.name is instance variable's name

### Self Executing Anonymous Function

```` javascript
; (function() {
  var superSecretVariable = 'i sure hope nobody knows about me';
})();


; (function($) {
  var superSecretVariable = 'i sure hope jQuery writes me a check';
})(jQuery);

````
What are the parens doing?  There's a function. Figure out there's a function. Then run the function.

var prefixed variables in functions are protected.

javaScript has ternary operator too

doesn't have sleep but does have setTimeOut (function, milliseconds). Returns id.
So we can also say clearTImeOut(5)

``` javaScript

var self = this {
  setTimeOut(this.tick.bind)
}

bind is a way to let the function be the this and not the caller.

 The HTML element that has been clicked becomes the this. So bind it to the function.
