## AM Lecture: [Orange Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/1.3/introduction.html)

it's a rake task

they are in the spec directory

code, Jasmine provides the global beforeEach and afterEach functions. As the name implies the beforeEach function is called once before each spec in the describe is run and the afterEach function is called once after each spec.

Here is the same set of specs written a little differently. The variable under test is defined at the top-level scope — the describe block — and initialization code is moved into a beforeEach function. The afterEach function resets the variable before continuing.


````javascript

describe("A spec (with setup and tear-down)", function() {
  var foo;

  beforeEach(function() {
    foo = 0;
    foo += 1;
  });

  afterEach(function() {
    foo = 0;
  });

  it("is just a function, so it can contain any code", function() {
    expect(foo).toEqual(1);
  });

  it("can have more than one expectation", function() {
    expect(foo).toEqual(1);
    debugger
    expect(true).toEqual(true);
  });
});

````

x = expect(todoList instanceof TodoList)
x. in debugger to find all "matcher" methods on orange jasmine

xit to put code on hold. un x it to make it the next test you are testing.

remember to test and then comment magic out and have it fail.

expect(Task.create).tohaveBeenCalled();

spyOn(Task, 'create');

arity is the number of arguments expected by a function .arity = Function.prototype.length

Asynchronous support for AJAX using setTimeOut

## Lightning Talks

#### Use phantom js for scraping

var page = require('webpage').create();
page.open('http://github.com/', function(){

})

#### JS Hint

install package in sublime

####

````
$(document).ready(function(){

  $('button').click(function() {
    alert('yay');
  });



````
#### Callback
````
var appendFun = function(){
  $('body').append('fun');
}
setInterval(appendFun(), 1000)
````
