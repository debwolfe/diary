git reset HEAD
commits point to snapshot

branch points to latest commit
HEAD point to current branch that you are on so indirectly points to current branch that you are on.

.gitignore & .gitkeep
git rm --cached

heroku needs a Gemfile
heroku needs a Procfile before we deploy:

web: bundle exec rackup config.ru -p $PORT
worker:

In your master branch..

````
git init
git add .
git commit -m "final commit"
heroku create
git push heroku master
heroku run rake db:reset

````


git checkout master (to make sure you're on master branch when you do this)

heroku create #name of your thing that will be in front of herokuapp.com#

git push heroku master


If you do stuff on a different branch and want to push to heroku:

git add and commit like normal

then:

git push heroku #name of branch#:master

For example if I am work on branch: branchname


git push heroku branchname:master


Also make sure to


heroku run rake db:migrate
heroku run rake db:seed
