# Friday Phase 1 Week 2

8:45am - Buddy Group Checkin
Topic: What are the tell-tale signs that a pair is suffering from self-judgement? Have you noticed this in one of your pairs or with another student in the cohort? (Please keep things confidential). Were you able to help the situation? What did you do?

1. lack of eye-contact, gazing around
2. listening and responding to other action going on
3. how far are you? to other people!


9a - lecture (building persistent applications)

**NOTES**

###Flashcards GregDixonDebGanesh

Fork the challenge repo to pair-branch and then branch it between your team.

A console app--work in two pairs. maybe merge pull requests.

user stories-- be as specific as you can? Don't say user...define who it is. Whose boots are walking?

Have something in front of you so we can give you feedback (that's what's wrong with waterfall).

Brainstorm these ones...

-- nouns--classes: card[question, answer, response || ''], deck, player, game

-- adjectives-- attributes--characteristics (Instance variables): correct incorrect

-- verbs--methods: guess, draw a card, evaluate, tally, report progress, high score, parse_file(filename.txt)

What's happening?  dive right into MVC right away

Create base classes and refactor into MVC

RSpec -- if your team wants it. What stage is it? Expect sounds like a user story.

What is the power of OO? It is readable. It manages the flow in discrete steps.

controller parser deck, deck and parser,  deck parses, flashcards MVC,

separate sequence from OO components

INPUT: few different kinds be explicit (Text file, console). ARE THE CARDS IN AN ARRAY?

-- read the directory to find deck names with DIR.entries (returns an array)

 -- parse the .txt file: single responsibility [ HARDCODE the parsefile for the other team]

 -- control flow of the console app

 -- spike on working with file?

OUTPUT:  few different kinds. String? Hash? Object? Array?

Which files do we want? Git workflow. Branching between pairs. Code review then merge?
  * runner.rb
  * spec.rb
  * flashcards.txt

Group Project Time - Break into Teams of 3 or 4
