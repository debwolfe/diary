### Monday

**Portfolio Challenges 1-4 due by 9 AM**

**Proposal for Portfolio Challenge 10 due by 6 PM**

* 9:30 - 10:00 Lecture: Introduction to JavaScript

## Notes

### Difficult Conversations

-- Feelings

-- Content

-- Identity

### JavaScript Intro

-- every line of code should have a semi-colon at the end of it. js lint

-- functions anonymous functions that do stuff and store variables that do stuff

-- foo.stop is not a property it's a function.

-- Create a variable and assign a function to it

-- read about hoisting (utilty functions don't do it)

-- function executions. Explicit return. (jscript needs a return statement)

-- loops (you should be able to use forEach in modern browsers)
````
things = [1,2,3,4]

 loops fpr (var i = 0; i < things.length; i++) {
  things[i]
};
````


#### OO (they are just a simple has)

-- there are not classes in javaScript

-- there are prototypical functions. Put shared attributes and behaviour in prototype.

-- __proto__

-- there are no class variables, no instance, no private, no public

-- most of the time we can create objects with state and functionality.

#### this

-- kinda like self in Ruby

-- but there is no way to store private stuff. It's a hash.

-- _oilLevel: 1234 (a convention for saying private)

-- oillevel: function() {
  return this._oilLevel;
}

-- console.log('ARGUMENTS:', arguments)

-- console.log('THIS', this) <== Window !

-- there is a name variable in the global space. call, apply, type

-- use ==== not ==. Or use !==.  ( contrast truthiness)

-- + plus will concatenate, - will subtract

-- check types, debug tools (are really good)

#### DOM

-- you can use class names instead of id. You get back a collection. Use a manual for loop.

-- you can think of it as an external service that you can talk to as a bridge

-- DOM manipulation, you do it a lot.

-- AddEventListener

-- button.addEventListener('click', function(event))

-- Why? fast, simple, and mostly because you can program in the browser to make a responsive page.

#### JQuery

-- a collection of nodes from 0 on up (even if it doesn't get any)

-- $ EMBRACE IT

-- when you are in a callback function use this (it could be event.target)

-- all DOM elements operate on single

#### AJAX

#### MVC in JavaScript


* 10:00 - 12:30 Pair on challenges


  * [JavaScript Racer](../../../javascript-racer-1-front-end-challenge)


* 2:00 - 2:30 Lightning Talks

## Lightning Talks

1. Just use var

-- global will always come before

-- not hoisting

2. for var i=0; i < array.length; i++

-- for (var i of arr)

-- arr.forEach( function (element, index)) <=== this is a good one

-- for(var i in array)

3. == vs ===

-- == makes type correction based on value
-- === have an equal value and an equal type
-- !== use this one for false

4. What is this?

-- this inside a constructor is set to obj being constructed

-- use that to save the state of the function when it comes to you

-- why? Because you have a child function inside that needs access to that (otherwise this would be child's inside function scope)

5. What is an object literal

-- use a trailing comma after last attribute

-- use a prototype instead of creating function inside object literal

````javascript
var obj = {

  name: "Bobby",
  age: 512,
  emal "hi@me.com",
}
````
--check out the trailing comma

##NOTES: Event-Driven Programming

-- asynchronous when you are in the browser.

-- operating on DOM over the bridge. render

-- when your javascript is done paint the screen

-- windows of time. First javascript, redraw, frame rates?

-- just realize that your code is called in a loop

-- in time, delay loop (sleep) setTimeout(function())

-- or event (schedule a callback)

-- wait for DOM to load, then bind to click events for our game to work.

#### Functional

#### Call back based

-- takes a function and calls a function inside

-- you may need to do something first (like wait for the DOM to load) and then call it back.

-- it may look like it's in order (functional, procedural), but it's waiting

-- call a, b, c
