## Spec Helper

Tests are awesome! Write at least one controller test that hits the database. 60%

Relish documentation tip: pick the right version relishapp.com

Example.org is the fake host name it uses.

rspec needs responds_to? Specify rspec 3 in Gemfile.  gem 'rspec' , '~3.1.0'

be careful of environment. use gemlock to see version of rspec

bundle exec rspec (in root folder)

Sinatra works on rack. sending sockets to ruby

look into rspec-html-matchers

## RSpecHtmlMatchers

config.include RSpecHtmlMatchers: allows for  expect(last_response.body).to have_tag 'a' :with =>{:href =>'/urls'}

## DatabaseCleaner

## Factory Girl

: objects on the fly for testing instance. Use simple and complex models. Good to have the motivation to learn.

use let syntax to only create data when you need it.

## Fixtures

json

```ruby
#spec_helper
require File.expand_path('../../app', __FILE__)

require rack/test

Rspec.configure do |config|
  config.include Rack::Test::Methods
end

#index_controller_spec.rb


require 'spec_helper'

describe 'IndexController' do
  describe 'home page' do
     it 'should be ok' do
      get '/'
        expect(last_response.status) .to eq 200
    end
  end

describe 'missing page' do
     it 'should not be ok' do
      get '/dontexist'
        expect(last_response.status) .to eq 404
    end
  end

  describe 'old page' do
     it 'should redirect' do
      get '/teams'
        expect(last_response.status) .to be_between(301, 302)
    end
  end

  describe 'old page' do
     it 'should redirect' do
      get '/teams'
        expect(last_response.location) .to end_with'/about'
    end
  end

end
```

response codes
1. 200 content-type is usually html or json
2. 300 redirect
3. 400 page not found
4. 500 server has no idea what's going on

## Lightning Talks

1. Ports: like a shipping port. Traffic can come visit you with by docking at your port 65535 possibilites

-- 17 gives you a quote of the day
-- 20 + 21 = FTP
-- 22 = SSH
-- 23 telnet
-- 53 DNS
-- 80 http
-- 110 POP
-- 194 IRC
-- 443 HTTPS

port forwarding is used for firewall take in packets and destination but re-route

set up IP address and then routed to different ports along the way.

port scanning

2. Internet protocol address IPV4(32 bit) 4 billion combinations

packet: your ip address is your return address & destination.  IPV6 has 128 bits.

classes A - E  207.175.46.232

3. RACK Christian Neuticirchen: interface or developing web apps in ruby ( used by Sinatra and Rails)

-- request
-- response
-- cookies
- params
-- session
-- configu.ru
-- gemfile has gem "rack" and gem "shotgun"

a. open ports and waits
b. wants http request to come in
c. parese request into ruby object
d. rack takes that object into http respone and returns it

4. CURL isa command line tool for transfering data with URL syntax
-- curl https://www.hackernews.com

5. https

-- Secure
-- SEO better
-- certificate installation
-- initiated on port 4443
-- RSA stands for some guys 70's. 2 prime numbers

## Sessions and user authentication

### User Stories

-- A user can sign up

-- A user can log in

-- A logged in user can visit secret page

### Log in Specs

-- enable :sessions for environment.rb
-- Form for user name and password entry
-- Database to store
-- send a get request from client to server. string.
-- hit a route (secret)
-- check user permission (Authorization)
-- how about send @username
-- look in database for @username and see if logged_in == true
-- put it up in URL (but that's not secure)
-- session is a cookie that persist for the time of a session
-- session is also just text
-- write a session & read a session: Sinatra & browser will help with these.
-- passed the session along with every request
-- redirect to secret page could do pulling along in response (you do get one shot)
-- send user id and session id
-- delete the session
-- logout (deletes the session)

-- lookout for overloading session, session still hanging about

### Coding Examples
-- encrption part: using bcrypt a Ruby binding double salted hash OpenBSD

-- install gem

-- User model has extra stuff 'password_hash' is the field name

-- getter  @password ||= Passwrord.new(password_hash) if password_hash

-- setter=

-- Password model

-- migrations RenameColumn password to password hash

-- def authenticate(password)
      self.password == password
  end

   if

  User.find_by(email: params[:email]) sets this

  session[:user_id]=user.id

  else

  flash errors

  helpers are available to view and controller

  skeleton session.rb has helpers do

``` ruby
require bcrypt

class User < ActiveRecord

end
```

```html
<form id = "signup">
</form>
```
-- maintain session across requests

-- get request to secret in console

-- session persists unitl you close the browser. (stored in a different spot than regular cookies)

-- cookies are stored in file system storage that persists.
