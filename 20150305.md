9:00 - 9:30 Phase 3 Pitches


9:30 - 9:45 EE Practice: cognitive bias & relationship to triggers (Are failure modes of thinking contributing to triggers?)


9:45 - 10:15 Lecture : Advanced Git Workflow

Git is a linked list of dif

dif is a linked list of git

p6 (MVC JS OO )

orange trees (OO and browser interaction)

cat .git to see hidden folder

sha's are connected by linked list

local and remote sha's (on commits). Git is decentralized (Linus specifically designed)

git fetch is for catch-up.

repo book, commit page, branch is bookmark, HEAD is where the book is open to.

commit things when they are useful. revertability. context of git message could be clear.

cherry pick or squash.

git --h

git reset (made a mistake to the index -- staging) unstage would be a cool word.

git add -N space-man

git add patch <=========== THIS IS THE MAIN NEW THING

adding a set of lines.

use diff to stage this hunk. answer e to edit. (change stuff in git land)

use git status to see what you think you are doing. THREE LAYERS

1. disk

2. staged

3. current commit AKA HEAD

git diff --cached (to review changes)

git diff show

git commit

READ THE GIT MANUAL

git -- help

git rebase origin/master -i for interactive [to fix a bug in spaceman]  (this displays in chronological order with oldest on top)

squash and fixup are ways to modify commits.

change to a commit if change is in the future. then force push.

git reflog (sha is referencing a branch) going through the mail to get something out of the

you can edit history so you look more awesome.
