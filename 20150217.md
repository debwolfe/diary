9a - lecture: Intro to ActiveRecord

##AHA

1.  class SomeClass

`
def self.say_something
  puts "something"
end

thing = SomeClass.new
thing.class.say_something
`

2.
`
a = [k1, v1, k2, v2]
h= Hash[*a]
h=> {k1=>v1 , k2=>v2}
`

**MORNING NOTES**

edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_migrations.html

we will use the ActiveRecord gem in Sinatra

migrations = blueprint

models = apply methods (universal place to put things about the objects you are referencing [ uh don't say attributes])

control code = actual ineraction with DB objects

convetion over configuration: validations

**Ruby Class, table (with an s), foreign_key_id**

User, users, user_id  (seriously s's)

You will learn something new all the time, AR is huge.

*Migrations* (they are a subset of database functionality postgres may differ from mysql)

-- timestamp: 20140201120711.create_teachers.rb  they live in migrate folder

-- action word: create, change (95%) , up, down (schema run all the way from the beginning to the end)

-- table word: t , id, created_at, updated_at are free (but include t.timestamps) and automagic

-- refererence data types for local systems

 *Models*

 -- naming conventions snake_case, singluar, filename matches applicable table

 --  define associations between classes => has_many or belongs_to your classes inherit from ActiveRecord::Base

 -- multiple inheritance needs? use mix-ins (composition instead of inheritance)

-- use activerecord (or its pieces ) as a mix-in (don't always have to inherit)

--  has_and_belongs_to_many, has_many_through (use this one)

*Validations (go in the model)*

-- make sure your migrations and models are ROCK SOLID before proceeding to here

-- prevents writes if validations aren't met. For example, name is required.

-- presence: true,  format, uniqueness,  etc

-- errors are added to object we are trying to save. orange.errors.empty? is the same as orange.valid

[*Callbacks*](http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_callbacks.html)

-- run at a certain part in the lifecycle before_save, before_vailidation, after_save, after_validation

 *Control*

-- all => Class. ex: retrieve records from table. Orange.retrieve

-- find=> Instance. ex: Tree.oranges reading and writing on that objects

-- tree.age = 9 and then... tree.save

-- C new and save (create and new)

-- R find, find_by_first_name("Bill")

-- U update_attributes(age: 27)

-- D destroy

**AFTERNOON NOTES**

##RSpec

put myself in the creator's shoes when working with a library

write your own version..how does it work? Is it it's own language? No, it's just Ruby.

require 'rspec'

describe used to tell a story about our test. For example "#ness" is shorthand for saying we are testing ness attribute.

*describe takes description and a block, puts description and then runs block with yield

* it takes description and a block, puts description and then runs block with yield

* expect is a method takes one argument too (as actual -- important! it runs it and gets an answer before it gets inside)

* to has to return self in order to chain (or store operator in instance variable)

* let dynamically defines a method
