9a - lecture: Active Record Associations

##AHA

1.  POODR. p 87. Duck-typing.  It doesn't matter what class it is as long as it walks and quacks (like a duck).

Inject the fruit into the tree. Send in a fruit object. Mighty duck typing. Whatever they need to do to win the game.

The coach talks, the attacker shoots, the captain gets in the flying_v(players). Get rid of a case (that switches on class) statement this way! Wrap the method in win. Pass in game. Game has instance variable puck & players.

** Notes **

###Conventions and associations of the ORM layer

file name and class name

class and table name (has an s--plural and singular: pluralize and singularize method)

Hash is the third argument (not a block), that's why a comma belongs before in a validation.

foreign key: name of table and id

migration file name: timestamp (Rails has a generator).

Rakefile
`
  desc "generates migration file"
  task :generate do
    time = Time.now.strftime('%C%y%m%d%H%M%S')
    table_name = STDIN.gets.chomp
    test = touch "db/migrate/#{time}_#{table_name}.rb"
    fh = File.open(test[0], 'w')
    fh.write("class \'class_name\' < ActiveRecord::Migration\n")
    fh.write("  def change\n  end\nend")
  end

end
`

### The association methods you get with belongs_to

** belongs_to ** goes in the class (which has id that functions as the foreign key)  order would have the belongs_to :customer

order.customer

order.build_customer (not saved yet)

order.create_customer(is saved)

order.create_customer!  raises invalid if errors

order.new_records? Will tell you if it is saved (does it have an id)

### The association methods you get with has_one

** has_one ** goes in the haver (the other class has a belongs to)

association(force_reload = false)

association=(association)

build_association(attributes = {})

create_association(attributes = {})

create_association!(attributes = {}) -- raises an exception

@supplier.account.nil?

### The association methods you get with has_many

** has_many ** goes in the customer model and indicates the foreign key in the order model

.orders

.orders << order

.delete (set the foreign id to null)

.destroy (get rid of the order)

@order_ids  = @customer.order_ids

.orders.clear

.orders.empty?

.orders.size

.orders.find(...)

.orders.build

.orders.find

** has_and_belongs_to_many* * [DO NOT USE]

intermediate join table. same methods as has_many

groups to users (both indicated as has_and_belongs_to_many in  each class)

CreateGroupsandUusers is a separate migration that only contains name, id of the group and id of the user, and timestamps

Link table does not have a model

** has_many:through **

second way to define many to many. if it has more attributes, then you need one of these since it gets a model.

In groups

has_many :users, :through => :membership

In users

has_many :groups, :through => :membership

memberships has its own id, it has a role (attribute!), join_date

now you have validations and call-backs and a description of what kind of relationship it is

-- Associations

-- callback, join, auto-generated methods

** Notes **

Putting all the pieces together. Migrations, associations, validations. What do the steps mean?

4 directory structure for what you need: db, app, spec, gemfile, rakefile

1. bundle install:  => getting tools

2. schema design:  sqldesigner => blueprint

3.  create db file:  rake db:creaate => pour foundation

4. create migration tables:  rake db:migrate => create wall framing

5. run migrations: rake db:migrate => raise walls

6. create classes so we can call create method in seed => electricty & plumbing

--  validations

-- methods custom

-- associations

7. ? seed: rake db:seed => move-in IKEA

Now you have tables but not classes

`
desc "populate the test database with sample data"
task "db:populate" do
  StudentsImporter.import
end
`

then sinatra

then rails
