#### rake:jasmine

circle ci is a service to parallelize the test suite.

 Lecture: Jasmine (functional code not have the server involved.)

 mimics RSpec but no magic method missing thing.

 You can just put 'not' in front of expressions and it figures it out

 use debugger in your tests. Isn't that great!

 You can grab e. as even and see the methods in debugger without needing [documentation](http://jasmine.github.io/2.2/introduction.html)

 truthy, falsy

 toMatch will look to see if a string is included in another string.

 you will share the value of this. However use a variable declared inside your first describe that all your other describes share.

 you can make helpers

 xdescribe will make a test pending.

 describe function
 it

 aspect oriented programming. spy puts a point count on method (see that it's called in the middle.)

```` javascript
describe('tree', function() {

    it("should", function() {
     expect(this.Tree).toBeDefined
  });

  it('should take a name and store on itself', function(){
    var person = new Person('Jared');
    expect(person.name).toEqual('Jared');
  });

  describe('#speak', function() {
    it(" should include name")
    var person = new Person('Jared');
    debugger
    expect(person.speak).toEqual('function');
}

});
````
before and each block similar to Rspec

describes can be nested.

var person

beforeEach(function(){
  person = new Person('Jared');
})


an asynchronous test to test ajax (use setTimeout)

or use ajax.js plug-in
