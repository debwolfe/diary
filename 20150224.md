## Sinatra Skeleton

Talk about dependencies in gemfile

bundle exec rackup

runs on port 9292

sinatra

runs on port 4567

shotgun config.ru

runs on port 9393

gemfile  ruby 2.0.0


## Lightning

1. Good Commit Messages

 -- use -v instead of -m or -am

 -- describe why change was necessary

 -- bullet points are ok (hyphens) with a blank line between lines

 -- use impertives "fix", "add", "change"

 2. Git Stash

 -- when you don't like it enough to commit

 -- git status : staged for commit

 -- then run git stash

 -- most recent one is 0 in array

 -- git stash apply will apply most recent

 -- git stash list

 -- git stash pop or drop

 -- or you can add stash identifer @{1}

 -- git stash branch testchanges

 3. Branch vs. Fork

 -- Branch is one kind of work flow. Clone - Branch - commit - pull request to master - merge to master

 -- Fork. fork - clone - branch - pull request to master  (for local copy) - merge to master - pull request to repo

 4. Git head

 -- A placeholder that tells us where to commit to

 -- Git checkout efg14, commit to that, you like it! But it's a detached head

 -- Then create a new branch called 'test' and work of changes

 -- Then commit and merge to master

 -- git checkout HEAD~2 or git reset HEAD~2

 ## [NOTES](https://gist.github.com/stujo/aaa3f8d9cff172354863) Active Record Relations ##

 Active Record is an ORM [Railscast](http://railscasts.com/episodes/239-activerecord-relation-walkthrough)

 one instance in the model is a row in the database

 Don't make typos because this works on convention

`
employees
id
company

companies
id
company_id
`

 class Company <  ActiveRecord::Base
   has_many :employees
  end

  class Employee < ActiveRecord::Base
   belongs_to :companies
  end

  has_many_through : can have model on intermediate table, need an index

  has_many_and_belongs_to: no data on the join table

When not following convention.. ## A SELF JOIN ## note that underlings is Domain Specific Language

  `
  has_many :underlings, class_name: "Employee", foreign_key: "manager_id"
  `

  migrations are separate from models

  Tuesday we write model classes

SELECT * FROM employees WHERE company_id = ? , self.id;

runs the query when it needs the data.

so when you run this in rake console, you'll see SQL running because it wants to show you the data

relations, then further apply before you run the query.


## Migration

use this in the migration possibly?

t.references :manger, :index => true
is short for

t.integer :manager_id

add_index

## Methods in models : Fat Models

format_name

short_name

badge_label

head_honcho (ulimately reports to => recursively)

### Scopes live in models as possible hanging out where clauses

scope :unmanaged, lambda { where( :manager_id => [false, nill])}

scope :approved, lambda { where( :visa_approved => [true])}

Employee.unmanaged is equivalent to  Employee.all.where(:manager_id => nil)
