## Lightning

1. Good Commit Messages
 -- use -v instead of -m or -am

 -- describe why change was necessary

 -- bullet points are ok (hyphens) with a blank line between lines

 -- use impertives "fix", "add", "change"

 2. Git Stash

 -- when you don't like it enough to commit

 -- git status : staged for commit

 -- then run git stash

 -- most recent one is 0 in array

 -- git stash apply will apply most recent

 -- git stash list

 -- git stash pop or drop

 -- or you can add stash identifer @{1}

 -- git stash branch testchanges

 3. Branch vs. Fork

 -- Branch is one kind of work flow. Clone - Branch - commit - pull request to master - merge to master

 -- Fork. fork - clone - branch - pull request to master  (for local copy) - merge to master - pull request to repo

 4. Git head

 -- A placeholder that tells us where to commit to

 -- Git checkout efg14, commit to that, you like it! But it's a detached head

 -- Then create a new branch called 'test' and work of changes

 -- Then commit and merge to master

 -- git checkout HEAD~2 or git reset HEAD~2
