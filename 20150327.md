git log --decorate

cat .git/refs/head/master it's a linked list (one or more parents only (not children))

git reset to sha a will change pointer

git push --set-upstream origin chapter3

git push -u origin chapter 3 (will put the entry in the refs file so that it will set up defaults)

remote repositories have to push changes back and forth

git fetch brings all the changes down but you might not see it until you switch to the other branch

git pull (does a fetch with a merge)

git reset --hard (to merge and go back again)

git branch -r

git commit -m ''

git log origin/chapter2t

the entire repository exists when you clone & fetch means sync

git cherry-pick is for applying a commit to the master (when it needs to go up right now)

edit to take away HEAD == , then git add. , then commit after a merge conflict

rebasing will make the history of your repo easier to read (a straight line)

git push -f (will need to force to change history)

index or stage (you can put these in the ready state) what is green in your git status

git diff will how the subset

filesystem
stage
git diff --cached

git reset hard will change all three layers (move branch, empty stage and reset file system)

get reset (by default it's soft) will just empty the stage

git add -p

git add  --intent-to-add chapter5.txt  <========= TO GET NEW FILES in your patch back and forth
