-- *I'm behind && I'm stupid*

9a - lecture (MVC tools and approach)
**NOTES**

### AHA Class Variables

```
class FruitTrees
@@num_of_tress = 0

def initialize
  @@num_of_trees += 1
end

# write your own attr_reader since none for class variables
def self.num_of_tress
  @@num_of_trees
end

end

p FruitTree.num_of_trees
```

### ARGV
an array, you could just call split


### CSV
require 'csv'   /looks for gem in usr/bin/ruby (vs require_relative for a file) or Math (it's part of the core library) or FIle.open (it's part of the core library)

### Problem Approach
user story process: nouns & verbs

in lists tasks attribute with attr reader

could also be a method

INPUT:  csv file, tasks from command line, delete, complete

OUTPUT:  the list (numbered)

Breakout lecture on RSpec | CODE!
**NOTES**


2p - lecture Why MVC?
**NOTES**

Short intro..then apply

We are writing an app, with a user interface, and that persists data MVC

-- Model read CSV + make objects (deal with persisted data, write, read)

-- View display list (parse input)

-- Controller dispatch commands (add, delete, mark complete)
1. Ask model to load csv and make objects
2. Run a command to parse the input assign command to a var and assign task to a var
3. Ask model to add the task to csv and save (or delete or mark done)
4. ask view to print our list


4:30 reconvene

###**SQL NOTES on JOINS**

LEFT JOIN — A  & sometimes B. Get all properties even ones without rent roll (but show the rent roll if you want, cuz that’s awesome A)

FULL OUTER JOIN  A & B (all y’all)— Get names from patients and employees of hospital (there’s been an outbreak and the green circle is 

RIGHT JOIN little a big B. Why not swap the table order and use a left join?

INNER JOIN A && B only properties with rent roll

LEFT JOIN WHERE B.ID is null. A is persnickety and doesn’t want anyone with rentrolls

FULL OUTER JOIN patients and doctors without any match-ups yet. (staring a charter school)
RIGHT JOIN B where a is null (again just use a left join)
