# API

active record is an api around data in the database

-- REST: intuitively guess how to consume API [Rest](http://ww.restapitutorial.com/lessons/httpmethods.html)

[Cookbook](http://www.restcookbook.com)

build one for another application to consume. Format at how you present information.
--curl -X POST--data "users[name]=Jared" http://localhost:9292/users

require 'sinatra'
require 'json'

writing and consuming an API

1. curl

2. [HTTParty](https://github.com/jnunemaker/httparty/blob/master/examples/basic.rb)

3. core HTTP libraries in Ruby

--- Just like jQuery but in Ruby and not bound by browser

```` javascript
response = HTTParty.get('http://localhost:9292/users')
users = JSON.parse(response_body)
````

decide contract and relationships

#### JSON read & write
-- parse
-- serialize
