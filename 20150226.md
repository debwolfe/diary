# Agile Development

-- not waterfall development

#### Read Getting Things Done to-do list. Brainstorm about everything there is to do and then move it into actionable.

-- software like a building. Blueprint. Go to work for six months

-- build an MVP

-- test as you go

## Conbohn [sticky notes] -- Team of Four is optimal, that is two pairs

-- ice box [login]  [about]  [obscure bug]

-- backlog [the most important thing to do next]

-- in process [ the thing we are doing next]

-- make a branch and do it

-- pull request

-- merged (checks and balances people)

-- draw your swim lanes between each.

-- dependencies

1. User story  (see below)

2. Time value on bullet point (calculate velocity )

3. Practice ability to estimate time

4. Where to include technical setup or research of tools? ===> Do behavior driven development

5. Do stickies on a white board instead of Bug Tracking System.

6. Just go talk to people. It's faster.

7. Propose new stickies when it comes up. Prioritize in stand-up.

 8. Be agile as a human


#### User Stories

As a user he or she can search for a video

As a user he or she can like a video

Stickies agile team: grab a thing, build a thing, merge it, and push it into production

-- Make branch
-- make migration
--  finish the feature
-- pull request
-- QA/ Product Manager look-see
-- merge to master
-- push it

#### Avoid Merge Conflict

-- use ReSTful routes

-- clone the main repo

-- work in a branch named after feature

-- use React

-- git ci

-- Your pull request? think of 'Merge Pull Request'  button as red and not green.

-- git log --decorate --oneline --graph (shows you parents not whether there is a conflict)

-- git fetch origin

-- git checkout -b home_page origin/home_page

-- git st

-- git diff origin/master

-- work that stu did

-- do a merge commit ? bring HEAD into tip (makes history hard to read)

-- Rebase!!!

-- git rebase origin master

-- in a conflict window there are three indicators

HEAD

 ====

 branch

 -- git add app.rb

 -- don't commit !

 -- git rebase --continue

 -- git push --force origin home_page


## Lightning Talks

1. Self Joins

-- users

-- followerships

-- has_many : followers, through: :followerships

-- has_many : followerships { foreign_key: :user_id, class_name: :Followership}

2. Where's PG

-- ps aux | grep postgres| grep-- -D

3.  Use source: it works just like class name (allows you to rename)

-- has_many belongs_to : theodinproject.com

4. Put requests & Get Requests ( Roy Fielding )

-- HTML standards

-- Representational State Transfer (style)

-- Post request is giving you something (can't do put? create a hidden field)

## Notes Heroku <== less complicated than AWS and Google Cloud (but more expensive to scales)

git clone

bundle install

have your application in the root directory

rake -T

rake db:creeate

rake db:migrate

sinatra on heroku: the instructions are great

heroku toolset

heroku run rake db:migrate

heroku run rake console

#### Problems:

-- not having application in root

-- migrations complete

-- shotgun and hirb and factory_girl should be in group :test, :development in Gemfile

-- faker might be in seeds file ergo production

-- rspec might be requiring rake in global scope. (don't put rspec in production)

-- WEBRICK cranky?  add ===> thin <===== to gemfile

-- git checkout -b heroku_deployment (feature branch to merge back in)

-- bundle

-- git push heroku heroku_deployment:master

-- byebug and hirb and better errors are not in production

-- trying to run rake tests bundle exec rake -P

-- Rake_ENV=production to fake it
