# Thursday Phase 1 Week 2

8:45am - Buddy Group Checkin
Topic: What do you do when you are feeling most frustrated when coding? Do you have any techniques to stay focused, interested and tenacious in the face of confusion and roadblocks?

1. irb
2. take a 5 minute walk
3. ruby docs
4. sample code (from someone else :))

9a - lecture (ie, intro to database design)
am - Databases - foundations

**NOTES **

##Schema: collection of tables that contain the entirety of your database

-- Classes  = > tables

-- Instances of classes  => rows

-- Variables => fields

-- use id (1 base index, doesn't fill in the gaps, auto-incrementing/ primary key) created_at, updated_at

-- relationships are kind of a big deal (time, patience,xanax)

-- orange trees have many oranges

-- primary key and foreign key

-- tables are always plural, snake_case, lower_case

--  convention over configuration

`
CREATE TABLE orange
(
id integer PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
orange_tree_id integer FOREIGN KEY,
diameter int NOT NULL,
name varchar(255),
juicy boolean,
created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
updated_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURENT_TIMESTAMP
);

`
-- no trailing comma

-- SQLLite3 vs SQL

`
INSERT INTO orange_trees

[x] got to 23. sql tutor :anchor: (stop at Progress: 44 of 51 exercises completed)
schemas and queries guidelines :anchor:

##SQLite 3

[ ] design a student roster :anchor:

[ ] design a forum :anchor:

[ ] design an address book :anchor:

2p - lecture - why MVC?

**NOTES

##RSpec
Domain specific language, the most popular one, features and commands

Behaviour driven development

-- A gem rspec spec.rb

`
require_relative '../cookie.rb'
describe Cookie do
  let(:cookie) { Cookie. new }

  it "should be delicious" do
    expect(cookie.delicious).to eq true
  end

end
`
`
# test.rb
require_relative '.runner.rb'
  describe Flashcard do
    let(:flashcard) { Flashcard.new }

    it "should be square" do
      expect(flashcard.square).to eq true
    end

  end



#runner.rb
  require_relative '.flashcard'

`

**Let** precondition is a cookie. There's just an initialize method. Pass it as a symbol and use it as a variable.

**It ** is the keyword that describes what we want in human readable terms.

**Expect** goes into computer land

New specification?  Change it, run the tests (they break) and then go fix the tests.


pm - Databases - basic modeling

[ ] design a family tree :anchor:

[ ] poll database :anchor:


live poll db 1 (practice SQL statements with a live database)

live poll db 2 (practice harder SQL statements with a live database)

5:30pm - Club Schema Review
6p - Review, refactor, read

STOP and follow these [directions](https://github.com/sf-fiddler-crabs-2015/phase-1-guide/blob/master/week-1/reference/guide-your-learning.md)
