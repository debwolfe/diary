# Tuesday Phase 1 Week 2

8:45am - Buddy Group Checkin
Topic: What has been your favorite all-time pairing moment (either phase 0 or phase 1). What made it so inspiring?
building cell class. Sudokode

9a - lecture (OOP problem approach)

**NOTES**

###Vocab

-- Class: blueprint for an object (instance of a class--model of a real world thing--behavior plus attributes--send and receive messages)

-- instance:  an occurence of an object, when created two instances would have different data

-- instantiation: creation of an instance

-- inheiritance:  descedants receive all the behaviour and attributes

-- composition: another way that objects  can relate to each other

-- module: to inherit

-- encapsulation: instance variable in a method so you have to call the method first before getting at the variable

-- attribute: trait, characteristic, abstract , data (nouns)

-- method: responding to a message, behaviour and functionality (verbs)

-- is a relationship

-- has a relationship (a container)

-- interface tools and systems of behaviours exposed

###User stories

-- Jobs

  --  Attributes: type, time slots

  -- Behaviours

-- Volunteer Coordinator (a kind of volunteer)

  --  Attributes: name, my time slots, my job qualifications, phone number, email

    -- Behaviours

-- Volunteer

    --  Attributes

      -- Behaviours

-- Time Slot

  --  Attributes

  -- Behaviours

2p - lecture (OO principles)

**NOTES**

-- What goes where?

-- Two fundamentals

-- single responsibility. refactor age method in orange class: generate_fruit, increase_height, increase_age all get called in age!

--  Avoid Megamoth (mega method)  [blog.codinghorror.com](blog.codinghorror.com) [=>!]

    -- cookies can not make an Oven

-- write crappy code first and then refactor to single responsibility

    'while unsolved
    unit reach end_of_board
      move_to_next_empty
      draw_board_animation if find_cell_solution
      move_to_next_cell
      end
      reset to beginning
    end'

    -- Decoupled

      -- Avoid objects that aren't autonomous eg don't control inner state and behaviour. Stomach is an array! Oh noes it's a hash.

      -- expectation vs implementation

      -- lulkas.stomach.pop stays inside vomit method

      -- lukas.stomach.shift stays inside digest method

      --  object autonomy means call a method instead of setting a field  eg.  **cookie.bake** rather than **cookie status: = done**

      -- smell the loops, smell the specificity

      -- implement tell don't ask

      -- what vs. how POODR [<=!]

    -- Law of Demeter (should only have two dots in chaining objects)
