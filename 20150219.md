## AHA (or ..whoa)

1.  gem install hirb

Hirb gemfile

irb $ require 'hirb'

hirb.enable

rake console can require hirb by putting it in rakefile task console, only

2.  coolness, cuteness

validates :coolness :cuteness {:numericality => {:gerater_than => 0; less_than => 11}}

validates: coolness,  :cutensess, :inclusion => {:in => 1..10}

3.   Person.find_by_first_name_and_last_name("Evan", "Huges")

use the hash instead with a where & with a first at the end

or use pluck. Power of associations & chaining

FYI: ||  there is JavaScript crap out there..don't do that. use the good parts. 'JavaScript the Good Parts'

pattern: free talks by Douglas Crockford

4.  In database model class. get at attributes which are in a hash--as methods GETTERS.

Metaprogramming: 'You are the wizards of our time.'

This was one for Active Record Jr. which did not have these

student["name"]

gets to ======>

student.name

`
self.get_row_info
  execute("PRAGMA table_info(#{table_name})")
end

self.table_name
 "#{to_s.downcase}s"
end

self.set_attribute_names
  self.attribute_names = get_row_info.map do |row_info|
    row_info["name"].to_sym
end

#now the subclass knows its own column names
def inherited(subclass)
  subclass.set_attribute_names
end
`

Or equals is a pattern in Sinatra and Rails.

@condition ||= condition +=1 (used during recursion)

** NOTES **

Inheritance of Active Record: this should make you sing

class Student < ActiveRecord::BASE gets you all this for FREE in the model

1. attr_accessors on all attributes

-- private :age = (for hiding)

2. self.create .new (unique id)

3. initialize

4. #destroy = self.delete (id)

5. where

6. find

7. #save

8. Self.all

9. Self.pluck

20. validations

21. errors

22. associations: has_many, belongs_to, has_many_through

What else do you get?

23. migrations

24. agnostic towards your database.

GET AN MVP for Todos.

** NOTES**

Work on our own passion project this evening in pairs(trios?) --four or five hours tomorrow

a database driven app with active record

use erb

create a gem -- functionality to make available to others? our own faker gem

work on a team: pitch an idea. negotiate, master-fork-branch

MVP -- limit the associations. Task.all is the same as List class

## Associations

artists have many albums

albums have many tracks

artists have many tracks through tracks

genre have many artists through tracks

playlist has many playlist_tracks

playlist has many playlist

metal.artists that's the ticket

im = Album.first
im.first.albums.pluck(:title)
Artist.where(name: "Iron Maiden").first.albums.create(title: "Code Warriors")
