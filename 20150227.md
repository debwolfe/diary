## Helpers and Partials

Sinatra::Reloader  gem sinatra-reloader
config environment file configu.ru
 (this will work in shotgun)

For example layout: it's the simplest partial idea.
yield calls the block that has been passed to the layout.
layout is a keyword: empty layout you are never going to see anything?
Order of operations is important. Layout wraps around.

use nav bar consistenty

#### title in erb, could be.

But here's how to do it in the layout.
<%= @page_title || 'Awesome Sauce Everywhere' %>

#### how to put message in layout

1. Use locals

2. Use instance variables

Flash gem: transfer a message from the current request to the next request.
-- store it in session!

flash_error 'You didnt do it right'

helpers do
  def flash_messages
  @flash_messaes ||=[]
end

def flash_message(message)
  flash_messages.push(message)
end

erb is a method (template, options={}, locals, &block)
to get to this we used: method(:erb).source_location

#### How do instance variables in controllers work?

-- the instance inside the get do belongs to the instance of the app in the controller

-- and they last for the VC lifecycle.

<%= erb :_navbar %>

erb: think of it as a function where we are concatting things

use locals instead of instance variables in routes get do

<%= erb '_navbar', layout: :false%>

get 'users' do
  erb :"users/index", locals: {users: users }
end

_user_avatar.rb
<div class="avatar">
  <%= user.inspect %>
</div>

index.rb
<%= erb :user_avatar, locals: {user: user} %>

.m Gem

### Lightning Talks

1. CSS Specificity (Estelle Weyl) X Y Z

-- #div id 1 - 0 - 1
-- .myclass 0 - 1 - 0
-- mydiv 0 - 0 - 1
-- universal selector 0 - 0 - 0

2. Fragment identifier
HTML sends to #

3. CSS Inheritance

-- a way to populate parent attributes down to children

4. Scalable Vector Graphics

-- 2001 images defined mathematically

-- rasterization happens at the end XML based

5. CSS Box model

-- content then padding border then margin

-- CSS 3 Box Sizing Property width/height

6. HTML Data Attribute

HTML 5 new feature

for accessing in JavaScript

--data-genre & data-album

7. Before and after psuedo selector

div::before {
  content: "Hello"
}

div::first-letter

### .env  Gem Jordon

-- Heroku planning for global variables. (your Sinatra app)

--- API

-- API keys

-- your password is in your code-- make sure not checked into git repo

-- .env Gem repo read me

-- require 'dotenv'
-- Dotenv.load <=== will have a gasp in Sublime cuz system can't see (nor can github)

-- Amazon might sue you if you take an API key and put it on the Internet

-- Hide it from github

-- But it does go to Heroku

-- In heroku settings Reveal Config Vars

-- Heroku config ENV['GCAL_KEY']

-- laptop has the .env file

-- How does our application get it, well not from Git!

-- it's from the config command line.

-- show a different address based on environment / make that an environment variable too...
