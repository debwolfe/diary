## NOTES  SINATRA w/ JARED ##

### Verbs: get, post, put, delete

Every URL is a unique id for a thing: get and post

Universal Resource Locator

Modify this thing and delete this thing: put and delete

universal adoption? Most browsers adopt parameters with underscore method

Restful (Representational state transfer )

app.rb

`

source "https://rubygems.org"
require 'sinatra'

get '/' do
  'hello world'
end

# index

get '/users' do

  @name = params["name"]
  erb :index

end

# new

get 'users/new' do

end

# read

get '/users'/:user_id' do

end

# post

post '/' do

end

# delete

delete /users/:user_id do

end

`

running on port 4567 but port 9393

get back http request as environment hash

path info, host, request_method as get to do routing yourself.

Browser sends test to our webserver, sinatra (app.rb controller) goes through and calls the right block.

When method is post, you'd expect to be creating a new thing (sending a thing to be created)

? query string not in routes.. in other words not using Restful rotues. (CRUD)

How to do non-hierachical /coordinates. Where to put lat & long

### Templates

you can make a helper

`

helpers do
  def some_helper
    erb :index
  end
end

get '/' do
  @foo = "bar"
  some_helper
end

`

how to get data from controller to view? With an instance variable

you can do ruby and params in template

params.inspect

http anatomy:

scheme host path ? collection of parameters key value separated by = then next one &

permissions will be in controller
