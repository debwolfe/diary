# Diary
Daily log of Dev Bootcamp (and beyond) code study

## Gather to-do's and notes into a daily file

It's fun keeping track of things. Since we are logging in from all over the place, keep a single spot of goals and history in a repo. This is a public diary so keep it sane and boring like [Nietzsche's laundry list] (https://philosophynow.org/issues/60/What_is_an_Author).

### Morning preparation
1. Keep the repo going on your local lap-top and commit throughout the day. 
2. Create a shell file in the morning at home based on the schedule listed in the Dev Bootcamp Phase Guide. 
3. It may be easiest to cut and paste from that readme
4. add [ ] next to items that you are taking as a goal for the day.

2. Name the file YYYYMMDD.md
3. Record subject (linked to learning goal if applicable)
3. Time elapsed (in Pomodoro's if applicable)
4. Plus/change on learning effectiveness for your style (concrete random, learn by example, humor)
5. Plus/change for personal interest guage. give yourself a sticker if you'd love to come back [=>!]
6. Feedback sketch for pair or instructor if applicable

### To do entry technique
1. Create an entry with a [ ] for undone. 
2. Create an entry for each day's anchor challenges with link to source
