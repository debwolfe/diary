Schema Group Review

[student roster db from schema 1] :anchor: (https://github.com/sf-fiddler-crabs-2015/student-roster-db-from-schema-challenge)

**AHA**

1) Procs & Lambdas

`
deck Class
@cards
  def each &block
    @Store.each &block
  end
end


deck.cards.each{}
`

2) use STDIN instead of gets.chomp

3) use @age or self.age: do you want the instance variable or the encapsulating method. Use the reader method instead of the instance variable. There might be some more functionality in the method.


**NOTES**

Decoupling, single responsiblity, MVC (meta pattern for separating concerns) user-input & output go into view.

Active record DHH. Patterns for persistence. Creating our objects..between us and the fle.

Creating flashcards inside Deck. How to do? parse method takes a filename and does Flashcard.new inside


kinda like a factory with a util inside -- just return an array of hashes

`
module FlashcardParser
  self.extract_cards(filename)
  Flie.open('flashcards-test.txt').readlines.each_slice(3).map  do |term, definition, empty|
    FlashCard.new(term: term.chomp, definition: definition.chomp)
  end
end
`

`
# just return an array of hashes
module FlashcardParser
  self.extract_cards(filename)
  Flie.open('flashcards-test.txt').readlines.each_slice(3).map  do |term, definition, empty|
  { term.chomp, definition: definition.chomp }
  end
end

def run
 cards_data = FlashcardsParser.extract_cards(filename)
 @cards = cards_data.map {|cards_data| FlashCard.new(cards_data)}
 @deck = Deck.new(@cards)
end
`

*Pattern 3*
cards can know how to create multiple instances of itself . I AM HORRIFIED!

encapsulate cards.all. Check out self.create_all

@cards = FlashCard.create_all(cards_data)

`
class Flashcard

def self.create_all(cards_data)
   @cards = cards_data.map {|cards_data| FlashCard.new(cards_data)}
end

end
`

hey, relax it's a class method.

Because now you can just give a Deck of  set of cards. Your Game class. the more lines you have the more complex it is.

Game has Deck.new. Deck has Cards.new?

**NOTES**

Active Record jr this afternoon - let's review the major operations

 [!<= oommand K2 in sublime shrinks (folding) & command J to unfold]

all, where, find are conventional methods

###Database Land - Ruby Land

C (create) - .new #create, #add

R (read) - #where, #find, "name = #{name}", #all,  #all_by

U (update) - #save, #update-attributes

D (destroy) - #destroy,  student1.delete(id), student.destroy

include and extend a module, layer between database and object (we don't need to initialize)

class School < Database::Model #ActiveRecord::Base :: means we can get just one class from namespace

###Directories in project

[active record jr ]- part 1 :anchor:(https://github.com/sf-fiddler-crabs-2015/activerecord-jr-1-a-basic-orm-challenge)

For this one, the instance is going to act like a hash. s1[:name] == "Bill" instead of s1.name
