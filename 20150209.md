8:45am - Buddy Group Checkin
Topic: What excites you about coding? Share a moment that really brought you alive when coding. What got you excited about it in the first place?
NOTES
[=>]I get really excited about MVP. Minimum viable product should come shortly after pseudoding. Finish psuedocoing as soon as you feel the MVP.
Little cars with Diana was so fun.

9a - lecture
am - Advanced Ruby

[ X] **NOTES**
### Git Practice
root directory of guide fiddler_contact.txt git merge

###Aha
aha 1 pass by reference
```
@var = var
dest_var = @var.clone
```

aha 2  copy by reference
`apple = {:name = "apple" , :price = 5}
orange ={ }
b= a.map { |n| n.clone}
copy each one not just
b = a.clone`

aha 2.5 metaprogramming for naming variable after name

aha 3
```
/([\d]{3}.?(\d{2}.?\d(3)/
\1'-''\2'-'\'3`
```

###Sukoku
1.  Have one source for Sudokode contract

-- playing telephone

-- How to see?

2. Variable names

-- who wrote this code? command G to change all to something comprehensible, option click drag , command shift enter, control command  [ <=! ]

3. More tests

-- get good at unit testing. how to test private methods?

-- optimizing test cases

-- make a separate tests.rb file

--  require 'sudokode.rb'

-- TDD baby or at least tiny bundles

4. Object privacy.

-- Get towards the black box

-- decoupling

-- law of demeter

5. Stub out complexity

[  ] prime numbers single responsibilty methods [ <= ! ]

--  box  you give us current index? give us back an array of boxes  back

6. lots of commits

-- can roll back by going to branch git co df76825

-- git log --oneline --reverse

-- git stash

-- good comit messages present tense active voice

7. remember general idea SUDOKODE

-- find empty, get_current, get_cols, get_rows, get_columns, set ROW_LENGTH = 9, current_cell_box_values

-- transposing

-- chunking

-- validate string length. you must be able to get the square root twice modulus == 0

-- solve single responsibilty 'oh you look so nice'


[argument order](https://github.com/sf-fiddler-crabs-2015/design-drill-argument-order-dependency-challenge)

--fewer dependencies is always better. using hashes as arguments. why? benefits?

[ruby drill](https://github.com/sf-fiddler-crabs-2015/ruby-drill-the-self-keyword-challenge) the self keyword :anchor:

-- how can we use self?

[enumerables]( https://github.com/sf-fiddler-crabs-2015/review-enumerable-methods-challenge) under the hood  :anchor:

-- apply self. write your own map, self, select

Review Sudoku

2p - lecture: Inheritance and Composition
pm - OOP Foundations

[x] **NOTES**
duplicate attributes
duplicate behaviour
refactor with inheritance: take out unique behaviour and unique attributes
use the super keyword
inheritance
composition orange has a tree
inheritance is a baker is an oven
inheritance is a? superhero is a humanoid (module)

default values, pass different number of arguments (just use args hash)
some shared attributes, some shared methods (can override in subclass)

args.fetch(:age, 0) remember this for boolean arguments too; args.fetch(:lovely, true)

-- A dishwasher has dishes (new)

-- A doctor is an employee  <

-- A tree has oranges (new)

Module is for behavior, remember that Enumerable is a mix-in (name-spacing Fish::breathe not holding space)

only inherit from one class but contain many module




make the tests pass :anchor:
classical inheritance :anchor: hierarchies are good
[orange tree 2](https://github.com/sf-fiddler-crabs-2015/orange-tree-2-groves-challenge) :anchor:

[orange 1](https://github.com/sf-fiddler-crabs-2015/orange-tree-1-just-oranges-challenge/tree/pair-debwolfe)

6p - Review, refactor, read
[ ]  REVISIT this to-do thus far

STOP and follow these [directions](https://github.com/sf-fiddler-crabs-2015/phase-1-guide/blob/master/week-1/reference/guide-your-learning.md)
